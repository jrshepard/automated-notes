<h2>NOTE 1:  DESCRIPTION OF SCHOOL DISTRICT AND REPORTING ENTITY</h2>
<h3>REPORTING ENTITY </h3>
The <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span> (School District) was established under the laws of the State of Georgia and operates under the guidance of a school board elected by the voters and a Superintendent appointed by the Board.  The Board is organized as a separate legal entity and has the power to levy taxes and issue bonds.  Its budget is not subject to approval by any other entity.  Accordingly, the School District is a primary government and consists of all the organizations that compose its legal entity.

<h3>BLENDED COMPONENT UNIT </h3>
The <span class="field" id="CharterSchoolName">(Charter School Name)</span> (Charter School) is responsible for the public education of all students attending its school.  The Charter School was created through a contract between the School District and the Charter School whereby all State funding associated with the students attending the Charter School and certain specified local funds are turned over to the Charter School to cover the cost of its operations.  While the Charter School is believed to be material to the basic financial statements of the School District, the School District (has chosen not to include/was unable to include) the Charter School financial data in its basic financial statements.  To conform to generally accepted accounting principles, material component units should be included within the School District's basic financial statements.
<h3>BLENDED COMPONENT UNIT </h3>
The <span class="field" id="SchoolBuildingAuthority">(School Building Authority)</span> was created by House Bill (House Bill Number) during the (Session Year) session of the Georgia General Assembly.  The purpose of the Authority is to provide, acquire, construct, equip, maintain, and operate public service facilities, to acquire the necessary property therefore, both real and personal, and to lease or sell any or all of such facilities, including real and personal property for the benefit of the <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span>.  The Authority consists of five members appointed by the governing authority of the <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span>.
The <span class="field" id="SchoolBuildingAuthority">(School Building Authority)</span> is a component unit of the <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span> and as such the Authority's financial activity has been blended with the <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span>'s basic financial statements.
<h2>NOTE 2:  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<h3>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</h3>
The School District's basic financial statements are collectively comprised of the District-wide financial statements, fund financial statements and notes to the basic financial statements of the <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span>.
<h4>District-wide Statements:</h4>
The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities display information about the financial activities of the overall School District, except for fiduciary activities.  Eliminations have been made to minimize the double counting of internal activities.  These statements distinguish between the governmental and business-type activities of the School District.  Governmental activities generally are financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other nonexchange transactions. Business-type activities are financed in whole or in part by fees charged to employees, students or to external parties.  
The Statement of Activities presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each different business-type activity of the School District and each function of the School District's governmental activities.
<ul> 
<li> Direct expenses are those that are specifically associated with a program or function and, therefore, are clearly identifiable to a particular function.  Indirect expenses (expenses of the School District related to the administration and support of the School District's programs, such as office and maintenance personnel and accounting) are not allocated to programs.</li>
<li> Program revenues include (a) charges paid by the recipients of goods or services offered by the programs and (b) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular program.  Revenues that are not classified as program revenues, including all taxes, are presented as general revenues.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fund Financial Statements:</h4>
<p>The fund financial statements provide information about the School District's funds, including fiduciary funds.  Eliminations have been made to minimize the double counting of internal activities.  Separate statements for each category (governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary) are presented.  The emphasis of fund financial statements is on major governmental funds.  All remaining governmental funds are aggregated and reported as nonmajor funds.</p>
<p>The School District reports the following major governmental funds:</p>
<ul>
	<li>General Fund is the School District's primary operating fund.  It accounts for and reports all financial resources not accounted for and reported in another fund.</li>
	<li> Special revenue funds are used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes other than capital projects and debt service.</li>
	<li>District-wide Capital Projects Fund accounts for and reports financial resources including (Education Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (ESPLOST), Bond Proceeds, and grants from Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission) that are restricted, committed or assigned to the expenditure for capital outlays, including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and other capital assets. </li>
	<li>Debt Service Fund accounts for and reports financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned including taxes (property and sales) legally restricted for the payment of general long-term principal and interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proprietary fund operating revenues, such as charges for services, result from exchange transactions associated with the principal activity of the fund.  Exchange transactions are those in which each party receives and gives up essentially equal values.  Nonoperating revenues, such as subsidies and investment earnings, result from nonexchange transactions or from ancillary activities.  Enterprise fund operating revenues are related to charges for (list items). The primary nonoperating revenues are (list items).</p>
<p>Principal operating expenses are the costs of providing goods or services and include depreciation of capital assets, (list items).</p>
<p>The School District reports the following major proprietary fund:</p>
<ul><li>(list items)</li></ul>
<p>The School District reports the following fiduciary fund types:</p>
<ul><li>Private Purpose Trust fund(s) report(s) trust arrangements under which principal and income benefit a (list items). </li>
<li>Agency funds account for assets held by the School District as an agent for various (list items).</li></ul>
<h3>BASIS OF ACCOUNTING</h3>
<p>The basis of accounting determines when transactions are reported on the financial statements.  The District-wide governmental (governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary) financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting.  Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, regardless of when the related cash flows take place.  Nonexchange transactions, in which the School District gives (or receives) value without directly receiving (or giving) equal value in exchange, include property taxes, sales taxes, grants and donations.  On an accrual basis, revenue from property taxes is recognized in the fiscal year for which the taxes are levied.  Revenue from sales taxes is recognized in the fiscal year in which the underlying transaction (sale) takes place.  Revenue from grants and donations is recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied.</p>
<p>Compensated absences and special termination benefit amounts earned during the year are not reported in the basic financial statements.  To conform to generally accepted accounting principles, the amounts earned for compensated absences and special termination benefits should be reported in the basic financial statements.</p>
<p>The School District uses funds to report on its financial position and the results of its operations.  Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial management by segregating transactions related to certain governmental functions or activities.  A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.</p>
<p>Governmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting.  Under this method, revenues are recognized when measurable and available.  The School District considers all revenues reported in the governmental funds to be available if they are collected within sixty days after year-end.  The School District considers all intergovernmental revenues to be available if they are collected within 120 days after year-end.  Property taxes, sales taxes and interest are considered to be susceptible to accrual.  Expenditures are recorded when the related fund liability is incurred, except for principal and interest on general long-term debt, claims and judgments, and compensated absences, which are recognized as expenditures to the extent they have matured. Capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds.  Proceeds of general long-term liabilities and acquisitions under capital leases are reported as other financing sources.</p>
<p>The School District funds certain programs by a combination of specific cost-reimbursement grants, categorical grants, and general revenues.  Thus, when program costs are incurred, both restricted and unrestricted resources are available to finance the program.  It is the School District's policy to first apply grant resources to such programs, followed by cost-reimbursement grants, then general revenues.</p>
<p>A substantial number of personnel of the School District were employed for a one hundred and ninety day (or corresponding number of contract days) period beginning in August 2013 and ending in early June 2014.  Employment contracts for this employment period typically specify that compensation be paid in twelve equal monthly payments beginning in September 2013 and ending in August 2014.  State grants to fund the State's share of contracts are disbursed to the School District in the same twelve month period.  In fiscal year 2013, these costs were properly recorded for July and August 2013 salary and fringe benefit payments and the related revenue due from the State to fund these contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  However, in fiscal year 2014, payments for salaries and fringe benefits made in July and August 2014 and the related revenue due from the State to fund these contracts were not recorded until the subsequent fiscal year.  Generally accepted accounting principles require that revenues be recorded when earned or available and measurable as appropriate and that expenditures or expenses as appropriate be recorded when incurred, rather than when funds are disbursed.</p>
<p>The net effect of the above accounting treatment resulted in the financial statements of the <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span> for fiscal year 2014 reflecting ten months of costs for a majority of General Fund salaries and fringe benefits. This accounting treatment is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<h3>RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR NET POSITION</h3>
<p>For fiscal year 2014, the School District made several prior period adjustments due to the adoption of GASB Statement No. 65, as described in "New Accounting Pronouncements" below, which require the restatement of the June 30, 2013, net position in Governmental Activities.  The result is an increase in Net Position at July 1, 2013 of (amount).  This change is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<table id="RestatementOfPriorYearNetPosition">Table Placeholder</table>
<p>For fiscal year 2014, the School District restated various Capital Assets due to a change in the capitalization policy and errors and omissions.  The School District (increased/decreased) land by (amount).  Additionally, the School District increased, net of accumulated depreciation, buildings and improvements, equipment and land improvements, (amount), (amount) and (amount), respectively.  The result is an increase in Net Position at July 1, 2013, of (amount).  This change is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<h3>RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR NET POSITION/FUND BALANCE</h3>
<p>For fiscal year 2014, the School District made a variety of prior period adjustments due to various errors or omissions, which require the restatement of the June 30, 2013, net position in Governmental Activities and fund balance in the General Fund.  The result is an increase in Net Position and Fund Balance at July 1, 2013, of (amount) and (amount) respectively.  These changes are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>

<h3>NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</h3>
<p>In fiscal year 2014, the School District adopted the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities.  The provisions of this Statement establish accounting and financial reporting standards that reclassify, as deferred outflows or inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities and recognizes, as outflows or inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities.  (As noted above the School District restated beginning Fund Balance and/or beginning Net Position for the cumulative effect of this accounting change.)</p>
<h3>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS</h3>
<h4>Composition of Deposits</h4>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition in authorized financial institutions.  Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 45-8-14 authorizes the School District to deposit its funds in one or more solvent banks, insured Federal savings and loan associations or insured chartered building and loan associations.</p>
<h3>INVESTMENTS</h3>
<h4>Composition of Investments</h4>
<p>Investments made by the School District in nonparticipating interest-earning contracts (such as certificates of deposit) and repurchase agreements are reported at cost.  Participating interest-earning contracts and money market investments with a maturity at purchase of one year or less are reported at amortized cost.  Both participating interest-earning contracts and money market investments with a maturity at purchase greater than one year and equity investments are reported at fair value.  The Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 36-83-4 authorizes the School District to invest its funds.  In selecting among options for investment or among institutional bids for deposits, the highest rate of return shall be the objective, given equivalent conditions of safety and liquidity.  Funds may be invested in the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Obligations issued by the State of Georgia or by other states,</li>
<li>Obligations issued by the United States government,</li>
<li>Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency,</li>
<li>Obligations of any corporation of the United States government,</li>
<li>Prime banker's acceptances,</li>
<li>The local government investment pool (Georgia Fund 1) administered by the State of Georgia, Office of the State Treasurer,</li>
<li>Repurchase agreements, and</li>
<li>Obligations of other political subdivisions of the State of Georgia.</li></ol>
<p>The School District does not have a formal policy regarding investment policies that address credit risks, concentration of credit risks, interest rate risks or foreign currency risks.</p>
<h3>RECEIVABLES</h3>
<p>Receivables consist of amounts due from property and sales taxes, grant reimbursements due on Federal, State or other grants for expenditures made but not reimbursed and other receivables disclosed from information available.  Receivables are recorded when either the asset or revenue recognition criteria has been met.  Receivables recorded on the basic financial statements do not include any amounts which would necessitate the need for an allowance for uncollectible receivables.  </p>
<h3>PROPERTY TAXES</h3>
<p>The (County) County Board of Commissioners/City of (City) adopted the property tax levy for the 2013 tax digest year (calendar year) on (Levy Date) (levy date) based on property values as of January 1, 2013.  Taxes were due on (Lien Date) (lien date) and could be paid in two installments on (Date) and (Date) (due dates).  Taxes collected within the current fiscal year or within 60 days after year-end on the 2013 tax digest are reported as revenue in the governmental funds for fiscal year 2014.  The (Clerk or Tax Commissioner) bills and collects the property taxes for the School District, withholds (percentage)% of taxes collected as a fee for tax collection and remits the balance of taxes collected to the School District.  Property tax revenues, at the fund reporting level, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, for maintenance and operations amounted to (amount) (and for school bonds amounted to (amount)).</p>
<p>Tax millage rates levied for the 2013 tax year (calendar year) for the <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span> were as follows (a mill equals $1 per thousand dollars of assessed value):</p>
<table id="PropertyTaxes">
	<ul class="list-inline">
		<li>School Operations</li>
	<li><div class="input-group">
		
		<input type="text" class="form-control">
		<span class="input-group-addon">.00</span>
	</div></li>
	<ul>
</table>
<p>Additionally, Title Ad Valorem Tax revenues, at the fund reporting level, amounted to (amount) during fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.</p> 
<h3>SALES TAXES</h3>
<p>Local Option Sales Tax revenue, at the fund reporting level, during the fiscal year amounted to (amount) and was recorded in the General Fund.  Local Option Sales Tax is to be used for the maintenance and operation of the School District.</p>
<p>Education Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax, at the fund reporting level, during the year amounted to (amount) and is to be used for (capital outlay for educational purposes or debt service.)  This sales tax was authorized by local referendum and the sales tax must be re-authorized at least every five years.</p>
<p>The City of <span class="field" id="CityName">(City Name)</span> (City Government) sold general obligation bonds to provide advance funding for Capital Outlay Projects associated with issuance of Education Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (ESPLOST).  In fiscal year 2014, the School District provided (amount) of ESPLOST proceeds to the City Government for debt services on said general obligation debt.</p>
<h3>INVENTORIES</h3>
<h4>Food Inventories</h4>
<p>Inventories of purchased foods and donated food commodities used in the preparation of meals are not reported on the Financial Statements.  To conform to generally accepted accounting principles, these amounts should be recorded in the basic financial statements.  The effect of this deviation is deemed to be immaterial to the fair presentation of the basic financial statements.</p>
<p>On the District-wide financial statements, inventories of donated food commodities used in the preparation of meals are reported at their Federally assigned value and purchased foods inventories are reported at cost ((cost method)).  The School District uses the purchases method to account for inventories whereby expenditures are recorded at the time of purchase or when received.  To conform to generally accepted accounting principles, all food inventories should be accounted for using the consumption method whereby an asset is recorded when foods are purchased/received and expenses are recorded at the time the food items are consumed.  The effect of this deviation is deemed to be immaterial to the fair presentation of the basic financial statements.</p>
<p>On the fund statements, inventories of governmental funds are reported at cost ((cost method)).  The School District uses the purchases method to account for inventories whereby expenditures are recorded at the time of purchase or when received.</p>
<p>On the basic financial statements, inventories of donated food commodities used in the preparation of meals are reported at their Federally assigned value and purchased foods inventories are reported at cost ((cost method)).  The School District uses the consumption method to account for inventories whereby donated food commodities are recorded as an asset and as revenue when received, and expenses/expenditures are recorded as the inventory items are used.  Purchased foods are recorded as an asset when purchased and expenses/expenditures are recorded as the inventory items are used.</p>
<p>For fiscal year 2014, the School District began recording inventories of purchased foods and donated food commodities.  The recording of the purchased foods and donated food commodities inventories is a change in accounting principles.</p>
<h3>PREPAID ITEMS</h3>
<p>Payments made to vendors for services that will benefit periods subsequent to June 30, 2014, are recorded as prepaid items.  </p>
<h3>CAPITAL ASSETS</h3>
<p>Capital assets purchased, including capital outlay costs, are recorded as expenditures in the fund financial statements at the time of purchase (including ancillary charges).  On the District-wide financial statements, all purchased capital assets are valued at cost where historical records are available and at estimated historical cost based on appraisals or deflated current replacement cost where no historical records exist.  Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated fair market value on the date donated.  Disposals are deleted at depreciated recorded cost.  The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of assets or materially extend the useful lives of the assets is not capitalized.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.  The School District does not capitalize book collections or works of art.  During the fiscal year under review, no events or changes in circumstances affecting a capital asset that may indicate impairment were known to the School District.</p> 
<p>Capitalization thresholds and estimated useful lives of capital assets reported in the District-wide statements and proprietary funds are as follows:</p>

<table id="CapitalAssets">Table Placeholder</table>

<p>Depreciation is used to allocate the actual or estimated historical cost of all capital assets over estimated useful lives, with the exception of intangible assets which are amortized.</p>
<p>Amortization of intangible assets such as water, timber, and mineral rights, easements, patents, trademarks, copyrights and internally generated software is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 10 to 20 years.</p>
<h3>DEFERRED OUTFLOWS/INFLOWS OF RESOURCES</h3>
<p>In addition to assets, the statement of net position and/or the balance sheet will sometimes report a separate section for deferred outflows of resources.  This separate financial statement element represents a consumption of resources that applies to a future period(s) and therefore will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.  [The School District has only one item that qualifies for reporting in this category.  The deferred charge on refunded debt resulting from the difference in the carrying value of the refunded debt and its reacquisition price is deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt.]  [The School District did not have any items that qualified for reporting in this category for the year ended June 30, 2014.]</p>
<p>In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position and/or the balance sheet will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows of resources.  This separate financial statement element represents an acquisition of resources that applies to a future period(s) and therefore will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.  [The School District has only one type of item, which arises only under a modified accrual basis of accounting that qualifies for reporting in this category.  Accordingly, the item, unavailable revenue, is reporting only in the governmental funds balance sheet.  The governmental funds report unavailable revenues from property taxes and grants and these amounts are deferred and will be recognized as an inflow of resources in the period in which the amounts become available.]</p>
<h3>COMPENSATED ABSENCES</h3>
<p>Members of the Teachers' Retirement System of Georgia (TRS) may apply unused sick leave toward early retirement.  The liability for early retirement will be borne by TRS rather than by the individual school districts.  Otherwise, sick leave does not vest with the employee, and no liability is reported in the School District's financial statements.</p>
<p>Vacation leave of (number of days) days is awarded on a (calendar/fiscal year) basis to all full time personnel employed on a twelve month basis.  No other employees are eligible to earn vacation leave.  Vacation leave not utilized during the (calendar/fiscal year) may be carried over to the next (calendar/fiscal year), providing such vacation leave does not exceed (number of days) days. </p>
<h3>GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS</h3>
<p>The School District issues general obligation bonds to provide funds for the acquisition and construction of major capital facilities.  In the District-wide financial statements, bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the straight-line method.  Bond issuance costs are recognized as an outflow of resources in the fiscal year in which the bonds are issued.</p>
<p>In the fund financial statements, the School District recognizes bond premiums and discounts, as well as bond issuance costs during the fiscal year bonds are issued.  Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses.  Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures.  In addition, general obligation bonds have been issued to refund existing general obligation bonds.  General obligation bonds are direct obligations and pledge the full faith and credit of the government.  The outstanding amount of these bonds is recorded in the Statement of Net Position.</p>

General obligation bonds are direct obligations and pledge the full faith and credit of the government.  The outstanding amount of these bonds is recorded in the Statement of Net Position.</p>
<h3>SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS</h3>
<p>Service concession arrangements are between a government (transferor) and a third party (operator) in which all of the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The School District conveys to the operator the right and obligation to provide public services through the use and operation of a capital asset in exchange for significant consideration. Significant consideration could be in the form of up-front payments, installment payments, a new facility or improvements to existing facility.</li>
<li>The operator collects and is compensated by fees from third parties.</li>
<li>The School District has the ability to modify or approve what services the operator is required to provide, to whom services are provided, and prices or rates that can be charged for those services.</li>
<li>The School District is entitled to significant residual interest in the service utility of the asset at the end of the arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p>On (Date), <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span> entered into an agreement with (company name), whereby (company name) will operate and collect revenues for (bookstore, food service, etc.) operations from service recipients.  (company name) is required to operate the (facility type or name) in accordance with the contractual agreement. Under the terms of the agreement the School District received a lump sum upfront payment of $ (amount) from (company name). Under the terms of the agreement, the School District receives yearly installment payments of (amount) from (company name) (company name), which have an estimated present value of (amount) In addition to any upfront or installment payments, the School District also receives a percentage of annual revenues.

<h3>USE OF ESTIMATES</h3>
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.
<h2>NOTE 3:  BUDGETARY DATA</h2>
<p>The budget is a complete financial plan for the School District's fiscal year, and is based upon careful estimates of expenditures together with probable funding sources.  The budget is legally adopted each year for the general, special revenue, debt service, and capital projects funds.  There is no statutory prohibition regarding over expenditure of the budget at any level.  The budget for all governmental funds, except the various school activity (principal) accounts, is prepared and adopted by fund, function and object.  The legal level of budgetary control was established by the Board at the aggregate [fund] [function]level.  The budget for the General Fund was prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The budget for the General Fund was not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
<p>The budgetary process begins with the School District's administration presenting an initial budget for the Board's review.  The administration makes revisions as necessary based on the Board's guidelines and a tentative budget is approved.  After approval of this tentative budget by the Board, such budget is advertised at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality, as well as the School District's website.  At the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board after advertisement, the Board receives comments on the tentative budget, makes revisions as necessary and adopts a final budget.  The approved budget is then submitted, in accordance with provisions of Official Code of Georgia Annotated section 20-2-167(c), to the Georgia Department of Education.  The Board may increase or decrease the budget at any time during the year.  All unexpended budget authority lapses at fiscal year-end.</p>
<p>The Superintendent is authorized by the Board to approve adjustments of no more than (percentage) percent of the amount budgeted for expenditures in any budget function for any fund.  The Superintendent shall report any such adjustments to the Board.  If expenditure of funds in any budget function for any fund is anticipated to be more than (percentage) percent of the budgeted amount, the Superintendent shall request Board approval for the budget amendment.  Any position or expenditure not previously approved in the annual budget that exceeds (amount) shall require Board approval unless the Superintendent deems the position or purchase an emergency.  In such case, the expenditure shall be reported to the Board at its regularly scheduled meeting.  Under no circumstance is the Superintendent or other staff person authorized to spend funds that exceed the total budget without approval by the Board.</p>
<p>See Schedule 1 - General Fund Schedule of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances - Budget to Actual for a detail of any over/under expenditures during the fiscal year under review.</p>
<h3>BUDGETARY/GAAP BASIS RECONCILIATION</h3>
<p>In the General Fund, accounting principles used in developing budgets on a budgetary basis differ from those used in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</p>
<p>The primary differences between the budget basis and GAAP basis are: </p>
<ol><li>State QBE revenue is recorded when received (budget) rather than when susceptible to accrual (GAAP).</li>
<li>Tax revenue received sixty days subsequent to year-end is recorded when received (budget) rather than when susceptible to accrual (GAAP).</li>
<li>Salaries and employee benefits paid to teachers under contract are recorded when paid (budget) rather than when the liability is incurred (GAAP).</li>
<li>Payments made by the State of Georgia for school district employee benefits are recognized as revenues and expenditures under GAAP and are not recognized on the budget basis.  </li>
<li>Other Difference</li>
<li>Other Difference</li>
<li>Other Difference</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, there is an accounting basis difference between the budget and actual Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances in the General Fund that is reconciled as follows:</p>

<p>The amounts described in this note are not reflected in the basic financial statements.</p>
<h2>NOTE (#):  SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES</h2>
<h3>ARBITRAGE REBATE TAX</h3>
<p>The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires issuers of tax-exempt debt to make payments to the United States Treasury of Investment Income received at yields that exceed the issuer's tax-exempt borrowing rates.  The U. S. Treasury requires payment every five years.  The estimated future liability of (amount) at June 30, 2014, is based on tax exempt debt subject to the Tax Reform Act.  The estimated liability will be updated annually for any tax-exempt issuances or changes in yields through (date), at which time payment of the final calculated liability for the five-year period is required to be remitted.</p> <p> 
Amounts received or receivable principally from the Federal government are subject to audit and review by grantor agencies.  This could result in requests for reimbursement to the grantor agency for any costs which are disallowed under grant terms.  The School District believes that such disallowances, if any, will be immaterial to its overall financial position.</ul>
The School District is a defendant in various legal proceedings pertaining to matters incidental to the performance of routine School District operations.  The ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently determinable, but is not believed to be material to the basic financial statements.</ul>

<h2>NOTE (#):  POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS</h2>
<h3>GEORGIA SCHOOL PERSONNEL POST-EMPLOYMENT HEALTH BENEFIT FUND</h3>
<p><b>Plan Description.</b>  The Georgia School Personnel Post-employment Health Benefit Fund (School OPEB Fund) is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit post-employment healthcare plan that covers eligible former employees of public school systems, libraries and regional educational service agencies.  The School OPEB Fund provides health insurance benefits to eligible former employees and their qualified beneficiaries through the State Employees Health Benefit Plan administered by the Department of Community Health.  The Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) assigns the authority to establish and amend the benefit provisions of the group health plans, including benefits for retirees, to the Board of Community Health (Board).  The Department of Community Health, which includes the School OPEB Fund, issues a separate stand alone financial audit report and a copy can be obtained from the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts.</p>
<p><b>Funding Policy. </b> The contribution requirements of plan members and participating employers are established by the Board in accordance with the current Appropriations Act and may be amended by the Board.  Contributions of plan members or beneficiaries receiving benefits vary based on plan election, dependent coverage, and Medicare eligibility and election.  For members with fewer than five years of service as of January 1, 2013, contributions also vary based on years of service. On average, members with five years or more of service as of January 1, 2013, pay approximately 25 percent of the cost of the health insurance coverage.  In accordance with the Board resolution dated December 8, 2011, for members with fewer than five years of service as of January 1, 2013, the State provides a premium subsidy in retirement that ranges from 0% for fewer than 10 years of service to 75% (but no greater than the subsidy percentage offered to active employees) for 30 or more years of service.  The subsidy for eligible dependents ranges from 0% to 55% (but no greater than the subsidy percentage offered to dependents of active employees minus 20%).  No subsidy is available to Medicare eligible members not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Option.  The Board of Community Health sets all member premiums by resolution and in accordance with the law and applicable revenue and expense projections.  Any subsidy policy adopted by the Board may be changed at any time by Board resolution and does not constitute a contract or promise of any amount of subsidy.</p>
<p>Participating employers are statutorily required to contribute in accordance with the employer contribution rates established by the Board.  The contribution rates are established to fund all benefits due under the health insurance plans for both active and retired employees based on projected "pay-as-you-go" financing requirements.  Contributions are not based on the actuarially calculated annual required contribution (ARC) which represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities (or funding excess) over a period not to exceed thirty years.</p>
<p>The combined active and retiree contribution rates established by the Board for employers participating in the School OPEB Fund were as follows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014:</p>
<p>For certificated teachers, librarians and regional educational service agencies and certain other eligible participants:</p>
<ul class="list-inline">
<li><b>July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2014</b></li>
<li>$945 per member per month</li>
</ul>
<p>For non-certificated school personnel:</p>
<ul class="list-inline"><li><b>July 1, 2013 - June 30,2014</b></li>
<li>$446.20 per member per month</li>
</ul>
<p>No additional contribution was required by the Board for fiscal year 2014 nor contributed to the School OPEB Fund to prefund retiree benefits.  Such additional contribution amounts are determined annually by the Board in accordance with the School plan for other post-employment benefits and are subject to appropriation.</p>
<p>The School District's combined active and retiree contributions to the health insurance plans, which equaled the required contribution, for the current fiscal year and the preceding two fiscal years were as follows:</p>

<h2>NOTE (#):  RETIREMENT PLANS</h2>
<h3>TEACHERS' RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF GEORGIA (TRS) </h3>
<p><b>Plan Description.</b>  The TRS is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit plan created in 1943 by an act of the Georgia General Assembly to provide retirement benefits for qualifying employees in educational service.  A Board of Trustees comprised of active and retired members and ex-officio State employees is ultimately responsible for the administration of TRS.  The Teachers' Retirement System of Georgia issues a separate stand alone financial audit report and a copy can be obtained from the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts.</p>
<p>On October 25, 1996, the Board created the Supplemental Retirement Benefits Plan of the Georgia Teachers' Retirement System (SRBP-TRS).  SRBP-TRS was established as a qualified excess benefit plan in accordance with Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a portion of TRS.  The purpose of SRBP-TRS is to provide retirement benefits to employees covered by TRS whose benefits are otherwise limited by IRC Section 415.  Beginning July 1, 1997, all members and retired former members in TRS are eligible to participate in the SRBP-TRS whenever their benefits under TRS exceed the IRC Section 415 imposed limitation on benefits.</p>
<p>TRS provides service retirement, disability retirement, and survivor's benefits.  The benefit structure of TRS is defined and may be amended by State statute.  A member is eligible for normal service retirement after 30 years of creditable service, regardless of age, or after 10 years of service and attainment of age 60.  A member is eligible for early retirement after 25 years of creditable service.</p>
<p>Normal retirement (pension) benefits paid to members are equal to 2% of the average of the member's two highest paid consecutive years of service, multiplied by the number of years of creditable service up to 40 years.  Early retirement benefits are reduced by the lesser of one-twelfth of 7% for each month the member is below age 60 or by 7% for each year or fraction thereof by which the member has less than 30 years of service.  It is also assumed that certain cost-of-living adjustments, based on the Consumer Price Index, will be made in future years.  Retirement benefits are payable monthly for life.  A member may elect to receive a partial lump-sum distribution in addition to a reduced monthly retirement benefit.  Death, disability and spousal benefits are also available.  </p>
<p><b>Funding Policy.</b>  TRS is funded by member and employer contributions as adopted and amended by the Board of Trustees.  Members become fully vested after 10 years of service.  If a member terminates with less than 10 years of service, no vesting of employer contributions occurs, but the member's contributions may be refunded with interest.    Member contributions are limited by State law to not less than 5% or more than 6% of a member's earnable compensation.  Member contributions as adopted by the Board of Trustees for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, were 6.00% of annual salary.  Employer contributions required for fiscal year 2014 were 12.28% of annual salary as required by the June 30, 2011, actuarial valuation. </p>
<p>Employer contributions for the current fiscal year and the preceding two fiscal years are as follows:</p>
<table id="RetirementPlans">Table Placeholder</table>
<h3>PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM (PSERS)</h3>
<p>Bus drivers, lunchroom personnel, and maintenance and custodial personnel are members of the Public School Employees' Retirement System of Georgia.  The System is funded by contributions by the employees and by the State of Georgia.  The School District makes no contribution to this plan.</p>
<h3>DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN</h3>
<p>In (date), <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span> began an employer paid 403(b) annuity plan for the group of employees covered under the Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS).  Recognizing that PSERS was a limited defined contribution and defined benefit plan which did not provide for an adequate retirement for this group of employees, it was the Board's desire to supplement the retirement of this group.  </p>
<p>The Board selected (name of provider) as the provider of this plan.  For each employee covered under PSERS, the Board began contributing to the plan an amount equal to (percentage) percent of the employee's base pay.  </p>
<p>The employee becomes vested in the plan with (years) years of experience.  Employees who had already achieved (years) years of experience at the time the plan was implemented were vested upon enrollment.  </p>
<p>Funds accumulated in the employer paid accounts are only available to the employee upon termination of employment and (years) years of service to <span class="field" id="SchoolDistrictName">{{notes.engagement.name}}</span>.  If an employee terminates employment prior to achieving (years) years of service, funds paid on behalf of the non-vested employee are credited back to the Board.</p>
<p>The vendor for the plan changed to (new vendor) in (date).<p>
<p>Employer contributions for the current fiscal year and the preceding two fiscal years are as follows:</p>
